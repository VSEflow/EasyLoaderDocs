# About VSE EasyLoader

Distributed by [:material-link: VSE Volumentechnik GmbH](https://vse-flow.com) 

!!! info "VSE EasyLoader Disclaimer"

    Dear customer, dear user,

    1. The software VSE EasyLoader is provided free of charge. Decisive are the provisions of the German gift law (§ 516 BGB). A liability of VSE towards the user for material defects as well as for legal defects with regard to the software provided is limited to cases in which VSE fraudulently conceals a defect (see § 523 (1), § 524 (1) BGB). Claims of the user for defect removal do not exist with free software.

    2. Apart from the above liability for defects of quality and title, VSE's liability is limited to cases of intent or gross negligence, including intent or gross negligence on the part of legal representatives or vicarious agents of VSE. In the event that the limitation of liability should be ineffective or partially ineffective, a limitation of liability shall apply as follows:

    3. The software and its documentation is provided "as it is". No guarantees or assertions are made through the content of the provided software. Likewise, no warranty claims shall arise from it. By using the software you agree to the legal conditions. Decisions to use the software provided by VSE should be made by the user in consultation with VSE.

    4. VSE accepts no liability for the accuracy, completeness, quality and reliability of the information nor for results that can be achieved by using the software. VSE accepts no liability for any consequential damages resulting from the use of the software, such as damage to other software, damage to hardware, interruption of business, lost earnings, loss of information and data.

    5. VSE accepts no liability for direct or indirect damages, regardless of the legal basis, that arise from the use, inability of use, possible hardware or software errors or incorrect system settings created by the user. Use of the software is at your own risk. VSE accepts no liability for software and information, particularly regarding their usability, accuracy, completeness and virus-free state.                  
        
    6. VSE’s liability is further excluded for damages caused by viruses, Trojan horses, hoax viruses or similar programming, as well as for programmes, programme parts or codes, which cause similar impairment, destruction or failure of systems or parts. The user shall take measures to protect against viruses and other destructive data.

    7. Liability is not excluded, provided liability must be assumed, for example, if caused intentionally or through culpable negligence, for guarantees of quality or violation of essential contractual obligations, , in the event of loss of life, limb or health as well as if liable in accordance with product liability law. Compensation due to violation of material contractual obligations, however, is limited to damages that are foreseeable and typical of the contract, provided there is no intent or culpable negligence involved. 

    8. Essential contractual obligations in the above sense are obligations whose fulfillment enables the proper execution of this agreement in the first place and on the compliance of which the user regularly trusts and may trust and whose violation jeopardizes the achievement of the purpose of the contract. A reversal of the burden of proof to the detriment of the user is not associated with this.

    This does not imply a change in the burden of proof to the detriment of the user.

    **DEFINITIONS**

    "Package" refers to the file or collection of files distributed by the 
    Copyright Holder.

    "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright statement or 
    statements for the package.

    "You" is you, if you're thinking about using, copying, or distributing the 
    Package.

    "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media 
    cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.  (You will 
    not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the 
    computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

    "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though 
    there may be fees involved in handling the item.  It also means that 
    recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they 
    received it.

    You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However, you may 
    distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) 
    programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution 
    provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own, 
    and that you include in your documentation, at some location where users 
    are likely to see it, all of the original copyright notices, as well as an 
    internet URL where they can download the Package (i.e., 
    http://www.spinwardstars.com/scrfonts/).

    4.  You may not create or distribute modified or derivative versions of the 
    fonts in this Package.

    5.  You may not sell the Package or its elements, or otherwise exchange

    permission from the author.  However, you may include the Package in a 
    Freely Available collection of shareware and/or freeware fonts.

    7.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote 
    publications or products that aggregate or use this Package or its elements 
    without specific prior written permission from the Copyright Holder.
